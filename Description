One of the challenges of web scraping is unclean data, and it natural. Different front-end developers write the HTML their own way, and that makes the incoming data unpredictable.

You'll definitely learn a lot about data cleaning with this dataset.

A huge round of applause for sofifa.com for providing this amazing data!

Problem solvings:
Converted the height and weight columns to numerical forms
Remove the unnecessary newline characters from all columns that have them.
Based on the 'Joined' column, check which players have been playing at a club for more than 10 years!
'Value', 'Wage' and "Release Clause' are string columns. Converted them to numbers. For eg, "M" in value column is Million, so multiply the row values by 1,000,000, etc.
Some columns have 'star' characters. Striped those columns of these stars and make the columns numerical,
i was able to find players who are highly valuable but still underpaid (on low wages)? (a scatter plot was used between wage and value)
Feel free to Ask more questions yourself after exploring the data set!
